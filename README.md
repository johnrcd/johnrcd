# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hey, I'm Rovi Decena! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Red River College Polytechnic, taking the Business Information Technology (BIT) program!

This is my personal Github account, where I keep any projects I've been working on. If there's anything notable,  I'll keep public for everyone to see!
